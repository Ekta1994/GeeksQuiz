# GeeksQuiz

The extension is useful for competitive programmers who practice mcqs on the very famous site www.geeksquiz.com/ . Because the quiz on the site are bifurcated as per the topic which we usually don't prefer while practising, the extension gives user the option to select the topics (from the checklist) and take a quiz of 20 questions which are mix of the topics selected by the user. The score according to the user's input (answers) will be shown in the end.
